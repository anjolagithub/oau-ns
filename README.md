# OAU Name Service (OAU-NS)

A Web3 identity system for OAU students powered by the $OAU token, allowing students to register and own their .oau domain names.

## Overview

OAU Name Service (OAU-NS) is a decentralized identity and social flex system for Obafemi Awolowo University students. The project consists of:

- **OAU Token ($OAU)**: An ERC-20 token used for name registration, tipping, and community governance.
- **OAU Name Registry**: An ENS-style system where users can register personalized .oau domain names as NFTs.

## Features

- ðŸªª Register your unique .oau domain name (e.g., `techboy.oau`)
- ðŸ”— Link your social profiles (Twitter, Telegram, Discord)
- âœ… Get verified as an OAU student
- ðŸ’± Buy, sell, and trade your domain names
- ðŸª™ Use $OAU tokens for name registration and tipping

## Tokenomics

The $OAU token has a total supply of 100 million tokens, distributed as follows:

- **40%** Airdrop & Users: For early users, students, referrals
- **20%** Team & Dev Fund: For the project team and development
- **20%** Ecosystem/DAO: For grants, growth incentives, and community
- **10%** Liquidity & CEXs: For liquidity provision and exchange listings
- **10%** Reserve: Held for future usage or token burns

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd oau-ns
```

2. Install Foundry (if not already installed):
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
forge install
```

4. Create a `.env` file from the template:
```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

5. Edit the `.env` file with your deployment information.

## Testing

Run tests to ensure everything works as expected:
```bash
forge test
```

Run tests with gas reporting:
```bash
forge test --gas-report
```

## Deployment

To deploy the contracts to a network:

1. Fill in your `.env` file with the required information.

2. Deploy to a test network (Base Sepolia):
```bash
forge script script/DeployOAUNS.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL_TESTNET --broadcast --verify
```

3. Deploy to mainnet:
```bash
forge script script/DeployOAUNS.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL_MAINNET --broadcast --verify
```

## Frontend Integration

The contracts are designed to work with a frontend application (React/Next.js) that would allow users to:

- Connect their wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect)
- Search for available .oau domain names
- Register domain names using $OAU tokens
- Edit their profile information
- View a leaderboard of popular domains
- Verify their OAU student status

## Roadmap

| Phase | Feature | Goal |
|-------|---------|------|
| 1 | Name registration + $OAU token | MVP & virality |
| 2 | Profile editor + social linking | Community flex |
| 3 | OAU Email verification | Trust + credibility |
| 4 | DAO & name governance | Community ownership |
| 5 | Inter-OAU or Nigeria-wide names | National expansion |
